A template is constructed from a charstream. Everything that is not in "<?" to "?>" will be outputted directly. Text in these markers will be interpreted is template scripting syntax. The following strings are valid:

- <?=$variblename?> will output "variablename".
   if "variablename" is an Outputable output this thing recursively.
   else turn it into a String (Object.toString()) and output it.
   
- <?=_This is free Text.?> will translate "This is free Text." into the users language, (escaped) and output it.
   
- <?=s,$var1,$var2,$var3,...,$varn,This %s is, %s free.?>
  Translate the last string. Output $var1,...,$varn replaced into the %s positions in the translated string.
  
- <? if($variable) { ?>
  Output/execute the text until "<? } ?>" only if $variable is boolean and true.
  
- <? foreach($variable) { ?>
  If $variable is an "IterableDataset"
  Output/execute the text until "<? } ?>" repeated as $variable suggests. 
  Special variables that $variable defines can be used in the inner text.
