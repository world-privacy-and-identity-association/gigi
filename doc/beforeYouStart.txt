Before you start using you might want to:

- use wpia-nre to generate a roots structure
- extract the gigi-*.tar.gz file into "config"
- execute "generateTruststore.sh" there
- extract the signer-server-*.tar.gz into "signer"

- download locales (util/ club.wpia.gigi.util.FetchLocales)
- write your sql connection properties: config/gigi.properties.template -> config/gigi.properties
- install "hosts" entries for the hosts you entered in "gigi.properties"
   (be aware if you change the default ones you need to change the CN given in the certificates)

- add the corresponding jdbc connector to your path.

- on unix-like systems: to securely run on privileged ports <= 1024 build the native setuid library (run the makefile in natives/).
  This expects JAVA_HOME to be set.
