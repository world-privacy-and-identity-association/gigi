Before you start using you might want to:

- create a keypair for the server (scripts/generateKeys.sh)
- create a truststore for the server (scripts/generateTruststore.sh)

- download locales (util/ org.cacert.gigi.util.FetchLocales)
- write your sql connection properties: config/gigi.properties.template -> config/gigi.properties
- install "hosts" entries for the hosts you entered in "gigi.properties"
   (be aware if you change the default ones you need to change the CN given in the certificates)

- add the corresponding jdbc connector to your path.

- on unix-like systems: to securely run on privileged ports <= 1024 build the native setuid library (run the makefile in natives/).
  This expects JAVA_HOME to be set.
