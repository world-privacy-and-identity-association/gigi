Before you start using you might want to:

- use wpia-nre to generate a roots structure
- extract the gigi-*.tar.gz file into "config"
- execute "generateTruststore.sh" there
- extract the signer-server-*.tar.gz into "signer"

- download locales (util/ club.wpia.gigi.util.FetchLocales)
- write your sql connection properties: config/gigi.properties.template -> config/gigi.properties
- install "hosts" entries for the hosts you entered in "gigi.properties"
   (be aware if you change the default ones you need to change the CN given in the certificates)

- add the corresponding jdbc connector to your path.

- on unix-like systems: to securely run on privileged ports <= 1024 build the native setuid library (run the makefile in natives/).
  This expects JAVA_HOME to be set.

For local testing you should:
- start util-testing/club/wpia/gigi/DevelLauncher.java and util-testing/club/wpia/gigi/util/SimpleSigner.java
- use the doc/sampleData.sql.template to create a doc/sampleData.sql file with a testing user.
  If you start the local test environment with util-testing/club/wpia/gigi/DevelLauncher.java, this user is automatically logged into the system via ticket bypass.
- in the case while starting the application a database error occurs use util-testing/club/wpia/gigi/util/DatabaseManager.java to adjust the database to the current requirements
